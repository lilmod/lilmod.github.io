# The Israeli Justice System

There are a few serious problems with the Israeli Justice system:

1. Judges appoint themselves.
2. There is no constitution, and yet the Supreme court pretends there is one.
3. It's the most activist court in the West.

1. Judges Appoint Themselves:

Judges, including Supreme Court justices, are appointed by a committee,
the majority of which consists of other judges and lawyers.
Politicians have only minor representation,
essentially allowing judges to appoint themselves.
This allows judges to perpetuate their political point of view
(which in Israel, tends to be very leftist) without representation
of the diverse points of view found in the populace.
This is itself would not be terrible, had it been the case that the Supreme Court
in particular was not political.
Unfortunately, while this was mostly the case for Israel's early years,
it hasn't been the case for a very long time -- the Supreme Court in particular
is an extremely politicized institution.
The reason for this lies with the other problems listed below.

2. Israel does not have a constitution, but the Supreme Court pretends there is one.

Israel is based on the Westminster model of government established by England.
This government model has a parliament, either two-body
(in England for example, for historical reasons),
or one-body.
The Parliament is unlimited in power -- any law can be legislated by this representative body.
The courts have the very important job of interpreting the laws created by the parliament.
The best laws are those that are clear and non-ambiguous, allowing the judges to apply the law
in the most impartial way possible.
Should there be a lack of clarity in the law, a judge may have to provide their own interpretation.
However, any application of a judge's personal interpretation is potentially problematic,
and good judges are wary of using their personal interpretation too much due to the danger
of personal bias.
Most importantly, the Supreme Court is unable to overturn the laws created by the Parliament.
At best, they can inform Parliament that a law is problematic and recommend changing it.

On the other side of the spectrum lies the US constitutional system.
In this sytem, a constitution, or set of elite laws, exists, that cannot be changed without
a difficult legislative process:
a two-thirds majority of both houses of congress,
that must then be ratified by three quarters of state legislatures.
The US congress cannot overrule constitutional laws,
and part of the job of the Supreme Court is to strike down laws that they believe contradict the Constitution.
